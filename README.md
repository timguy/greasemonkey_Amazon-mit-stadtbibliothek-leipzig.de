# Further
- Only tested with greasemonkey, may work with tampermonkey in chrome
- If you can improve, please do.
- for errors or problems open an issue

# Possible improvements
- make it possible to save a list for your next library visit
- ask the library for a better interface / direkt API instead to parse cookies
- maybe restrict for some library locations
- not only check on book detail page but already for multiple books in overview page
- ask only once for the cookie and afterwars only when needed
