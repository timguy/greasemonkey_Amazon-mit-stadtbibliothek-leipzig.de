# Install
If you have [violentmonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) for firefox [just click the link](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timguy/greasemonkey_Amazon-mit-stadtbibliothek-leipzig.de/master/amazon_mit_stadtbibliothek-leipzig.de.user.js)

Should look like this later on:

<kbd>
  
# Further
- May work with tampermonkey in chrome
- If you can improve, please do.
- for errors or problems open an issue
- Script was not working in greasemonkey [anymore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60742559/greasemonkey-gm-xmlhttprequest-response-headers-missing?noredirect=1#comment107471237_60742559) so I had to switch to violentmonkey addon.

# Possible improvements
- make it possible to save a list for your next library visit
- ask the library for a better interface / direkt API instead to parse cookies
- maybe restrict for some library locations
- not only check on book detail page but already for multiple books in overview page
- ask only once for the cookie and afterwars only when needed
